K46-03 Sparklebug
=================

This is a fictional transport spacecraft; any similarity with real or fictional
aircraft or spacecraft is accidental and completely unintentional.

Characteristics
---------------

The Sparklebug is a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO), vertical takeoff/landing
(VTOL) transport spacecraft.

It is equipped with the following propulsion systems:

- Air-breathing main engines (4, though only 2 currently simulated), mounted in
  two rotating nacelles on the wing tips.
- Rocket engine (3, though only 1 currently simulated), mounted in the tail.
- 12 RCS thrusters.

A typical mission would involve the following flight phases:

- Vertical takeoff
- Accelerate to subsonic climb speed, main engines provide lift and thrust
- At a suitable altitude, engage afterburners, tilt main engines forward,
  and go supersonic. Wings now provide sufficient lift for sustained
  aerodynamic flight.
- Supersonic climb to upper atmosphere.
- Engage rocket engine to continue climb and acceleration
- Main engine shutoff around 100k ft
- Orbital insertion using rocket engine and RCS
- Deorbit burn using rocket engine
- Ballistic descent to upper atmosphere; pitch up ~40 degrees for optimal drag
- Main engines started once air density is sufficient, pointed down to further
  decrease speed
- Transition to aerodynamic flight, glide down to a suitable atmospheric cruise
  altitude and speed
- Approach destination in aerodynamic flight
- Vertical landing

Development Status
------------------

- FDM:
    - aerodynamic: working.
    - propulsion: working, but need to make it 4 main engines and 3 rocket
      thrusters instead of 2 + 1.
    - aerodynamic control surfaces: TODO
    - ground effect: TODO
    - mach drag: TODO
- 3D model:
    - hull somewhat complete, but needs detail work
    - landing gear: TODO
    - textures and UV mapping: TODO
    - cockpit & instruments: TODO
    - interior: TODO
    - doors, windows: TODO
    - particle animations for engines etc.: TODO
- Systems:
    - FBW: largely done, needs bugfixing (goes unstable in some situations)
    - instruments: TODO
    - autopilot: TODO
    - fuel systems, reactor: TODO
